How to run Java CDF Tools
-------------------------

Note for Mac OS X users: 
      If you installed the pre-bulit package (universal binary), all 
      environment variables mentioned below are set automatically in
      your log-in shell. They are defined when a terminal session is open.
      Alternatively, you can doble-click the CDFToolsDriver.app from Finder
      to invoke the application. No need to set up the environment variables,
      either. If you build the libraries and tools from the source code, then
      the following steps are needed to define the environment variables for
      running the Java tools.

    For Windows users:
      If use the pre-built package, just click the CDFToolsDriver from
      "Start" -> "All Programs" -> "CDF Distribution...". 
      All are set when the is installed.

1. Set the CLASSPATH environment variable.

   CLASSPATH should point to the the locations (full path names) of the 
   following files:

        <cdf_dir>/cdfjava/cdftools/CDFToolsDriver.jar
        <cdf_dir>/cdfjava/classes/cdfjava.jar
        <cdf_dir>/cdfjava/cdfml/cdfml.jar

   Example:
      setenv CLASSPATH .:/home/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/cdfjava/classes/cdfjava.jar: \
             /home/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/cdfjava/cdftools/CDFToolsDriver.jar \
             /home/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/cdfjava/cdfml/cdfml.jar
         
        
2. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

   LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for Mac OS X) should point to the 
   following files:
   
   - the location (full path name) of the libcdfNativeLibrary.[so|sl|jnilib]

   - the location (full path name) of the CDF library (libcdf.[so|sl|dylib]

   Example: 
      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/home/cdf/cdf33_-dist/cdfjava/lib: \
             /home/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/lib 

      Or, for Mac OS X,

      setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH .:/Users/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/cdfjava/lib: \
             /Users/cdf/cdf33_2-dist/lib 
         

3. Invoke a desired CDF tool as follows:

   At the operating system prompt, type "java CDFToolsDriver".

   This will bring up the main menu from which a desired tool can be invoked by
   selecting the desired CDF tool with a single click. 

   IMPORTANT NOTE:
       Make sure you run the one of the definition files in the <cdf_dir>/bin
       directory (e.g.  definitions.[C | B | K] before you execute the 
       above command so that the CDF_BASE environment variable is defined.

3. Please note: 
      For those programs that allow the option of directing the output 
      to the screen, instead of a file, make sure that the output is not 
      too big.  The Java Virtual Machine may hung or run out of memory 
      for a big output.
