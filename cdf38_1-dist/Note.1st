                            * Warning *

The OS/ENV combination you have selected has not been tested.  The
options which will be used are based on previous experiences with the
operating system being used.  If an error occurs, don't panic, simply
contact us [NASA-CDF-Support@nasa.onmicrosoft.com].  The reason that your
OS/ENV combination is not tested is probably because we no longer have
a guest account on a machine having that particular OS/ENV combination.
If you would like to offer us a guest account for testing purposes we
would be very happy to hear from you.  In fact, we would even build/test
the CDF distribution on your machine for you.

If this `make' completes without any warnings or errors, please let us
know so we can remove this warning.  Anyway, here we go...
