`make test' is used to test the CDF library.  The tests for the C interfaces
are always performed.  The tests for the Fortran interfaces are only performed
if Fortran testing was requested during the `make all' step.  The tests for
the interfaces to the shareable CDF library are only performed if the operating
system being used supports shareable libraries.
