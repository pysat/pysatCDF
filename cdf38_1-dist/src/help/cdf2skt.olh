SkeletonTable is used to create a skeleton table file from a CDF.  The
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when SkeletonTable is 'executed'
contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The pathname of the CDF from which a skeleton table
                       will be created.  At the end of this field a button
                       labeled "Select" is present.  When selected, a
                       standard input file dialog is displayed from which
                       the CDF may be selected.

  Skeleton:            The pathname of the skeleton table to be created.  At
                       the end of this field a button labeled "Select" is
                       present.  When selected, a standard output file dialog
                       is displayed in which the skeleton table pathname may
                       be specified.  Don't specify an extension - '.skt' is
                       appended automatically.  If this field is left blank,
                       the skeleton table name defaults to the name of the CDF
                       (with '.skt' appended) and is placed in the folder
                       containing the SkeletonTable executable.  The "Output
                       to screen" check box also affects the destination of
                       the skeleton table.

  Cache sizes:         The number of buffers to be used for the CDF's dotCDF
                       file, staging file, and compression scratch file. 
                       This field, used only in the CDF access process during
                       the run, will not change the contents of the skeleton
                       table. Large number(s) will likely reduce physical I/Os
                       if variable data are involved.  If this field is left
                       blank, default cache sizes chosen by the CDF library
                       are used.  The cache sizes are specified with a
                       comma-separated list of <number><type> pairs where
                       <number> is the number of cache buffers and <type> is
                       the type of file.  The file <type>'s are as follows:
                       'd' for the dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and
                       'c' for the compression scratch file.  For example,
                       '200d,100s' specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF
                       file and 100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The
                       dotCDF file cache size can also be specified without
                       the 'd' <type> for compatibility with older CDF
                       releases (eg.  '200,100s').  Note that not all of the
                       file types must be specified.  Those not specified
                       will receive a default cache size.

  Variables:           If the values for selected variables are to be
                       displayed, this field should contain a comma-separated
                       list of delimited variable names.  See the 'Selected
                       variables' radio button.

Check boxes for...

  Output to screen:    Whether or not the skeleton table is displayed on the
                       screen in the 'SkeletonTable: standard output' window.
                       If not checked, the skeleton table is written to a
                       file.

  Use FORMAT:          Whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                       writing variable values (if the FORMAT attribute
                       exists and an entry exists for the variable).

  -0.0 to 0.0:         Whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                       library when read from a CDF.

  Page output:         If the skeleton table is being displayed on the screen,
                       whether or not the output is displayed one page (screen)
                       at a time.

  Report info's:       Whether or not informational status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report warnings:     Whether or not warning status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Log progress:        Whether or not progress messages are displayed.

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each CDF.

Radio buttons for...

  zMode:               The zMode to be used for the CDF.
                          0...zMode is disabled.
                          1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                              variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                          2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                              rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                              are hidden.

  No values:           Place no variable values in the skeleton table.
  NRV values:          Place only NRV variable values in the skeleton table.
  RV values:           Place only RV variable values in the skeleton table.
  All values:          Place all variable values in the skeleton table.
  Selected values:     Place the values of the variables named in the
                       'Variables' edit field in the skeleton table.

Purpose:       SkeletonTable produces a skeleton table from a CDF.  A
               skeleton table is a text file which can be read by the
               SkeletonCDF program to build a skeleton CDF.

Parameter(s):  <cdf-path>
                  The pathname of the CDF from which the skeleton table
                  will be created.  Do not enter an extension.

#ifos vms
Qualifier(s):  /SKELETON=<skeleton-path>
                  <skeleton-path> is the pathname of the skeleton table
                  to be created.  (Do not enter an extension because ".SKT"
                  is appended automatically).  If not specified, the
                  skeleton table is named <cdf-name>.SKT in the default
                  directory (where <cdf-name> is the name portion of
                  <cdf-path>).
#else
Qualifier(s):  -skeleton <skeleton-path>
                  <skeleton-path> is the pathname of the skeleton table
                  to be created.  (Do not enter an extension because ".skt"
                  is appended automatically).  If not specified, the
                  skeleton table is named <cdf-name>.skt in the current
                  directory (where <cdf-name> is the name portion of
                  <cdf-path>).
#endos

#ifos vms
               /VALUES=<values> | /NONRV | /NRVTABLE
                  Only one of these qualifiers may be specified.  /NONRV and
                  /NRVTABLE are not longer necessary but are supported for
                  compatibility with previous CDF distributions.
                    /NONRV
                       Ignore all NRV data values.  This is equivalent to
                       using '/VALUES=NONE'.
                    /NRVTABLE
                       Put NRV data values in the skeleton table.  This is
                       equivalent to using '/VALUES=NRV'.
                    /VALUES=<values>
                       Where <values> specifies which variable values are to
                       be put in the skeleton table.  <values> may be one of
                       the following...
                         NONE........No variable values.
                         NRV.........NRV variable values.
                         RV..........RV variable values.
                         ALL.........All variable values.
                         <named>.....Named variables.  <named> is a comma-
                                     separated list of delimited variable
                                     names enclosed in double quote marks.
                                     Do not use double quote marks to delimit
                                     a variable name.
#else
               -values <values> | -nonrv | -nrvtable
                  Only one of these qualifiers may be specified.  '-nonrv' and
                  '-nrvtable' are not longer necessary but are supported for
                  compatibility with previous CDF distributions.
                    -nonrv
                       Ignore all NRV data values.  This is equivalent to
                       using '-values none'.
                    -nrvtable
                       Put NRV data values in the skeleton table.  This is
                       equivalent to using '-value nrv'.
                    -values <values>
                       Where <values> specifies which variable values are to
                       be put in the skeleton table.  <values> may be one of
                       the following...
                         'none'......No variable values.
                         'nrv'.......NRV variable values.
                         'rv'........RV variable values.
                         'all'.......All variable values.
                         <named>.....Named variables.  <named> is a comma-
                                     separated list of delimited variable
                                     names enclosed by double quote marks.
                                     Do not use double quote marks to delimit
                                     a variable name.

                  If this qualifier is absent, default cache sizes chosen by
                  the CDF library are used.  The cache sizes are specified
                  with a comma-separated list of <number><type> pairs where
                  <number> is the number of cache buffers and <type> is the
                  type of file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for
                  the dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for the
                  compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                  specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and 100
                  cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF file cache
                  size can also be specified without the 'd' <type> for
                  compatibility with older CDF releases (eg. '200,100s').
                  Note that not all of the file types must be specified.
                  Those not specified will receive a default cache size.

                  If the skeleton table is being displayed on the terminal
                  screen, specifies whether or not the output is displayed
                  one page (screen) at a time.

                  Specifies whether or not the CDF epoch data should be
                  presented in ISO8601 form (without or with Z). Currently,
                  only TT2000 data are shown in this form (without Z). Both
                  CDF_EPOCH and CDF_EPOCH16 data are encoded in the standard
                  style form by default (as dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ccc or
                  dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss.ccc.uuu.nnn.ppp respectively).

                  Specifies how a variable's FORMAT attribute is used if it
                  exists. This option mainly applies to floating-point data
                  values. The valid options are: "best", "no", "metaonly",
                  "dataonly" and "all". The "best" option is intended to
                  make a skeleton table to preserve the CDF's data contents
                  as precisely as possible so it can be reversed back to
                  its original value via skt2cdf application. This option
                  may or may not use the FORMAT attribute for both metadata
                  and variable data, depending on its value. Non-format
                  (as C's "%g") may be used even FORMAT is present if the
                  value is either too large or too small, which is not
                  suitable to use format. Option "no" will ignore the FORMAT
                  attribute format and use C's general "%g" form. Option 
                  "metaonly" only applies format to variable's metadata, 
                  while option "dataonly" to variable's data. "all" option 
                  will enforce the use of format for encoding both variable 
                  metadata and data. This new option supersedes the older 
                  "[no]format" option. If neither this option nor 
                  "[no]format" option is specified, "best" is the default.  
                  Note: if FORMAT is specified as a hexadecimal form, as "Z" 
                  or "X", only data will use its format unless "all" option 
                  is chosen. "best" option is the default, if "format" and
                  "noformat" is not specified. Make sure that FORMAT
                  attributes are set properly.
