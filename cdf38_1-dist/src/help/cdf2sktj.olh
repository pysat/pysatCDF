SkeletonTable is used to create a skeleton table file from a CDF.  The
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when SkeletonTable is 'executed'
contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The file name of the CDF from which a skeleton table
                       will be created.  At the end of this field a button
                       labeled "Select 1" is present.  When selected, a
                       standard input file dialog is displayed from which
                       the CDF may be selected. Once a CDF is selected, its
                       extension is automatically removed if it exists before 
                       its full file name is displayed.

  Skeleton:            The file name of the skeleton table to be created.  At
                       the end of this field a button labeled "Select 2" is
                       present.  When selected, a standard output file dialog
                       is displayed in which the skeleton table file name may
                       be specified.  Don't specify an extension - '.skt' is
                       appended automatically.  If this field is left blank,
                       the skeleton table name defaults to the name of the CDF
                       (with '.skt' appended) and is placed in the folder
                       containing the SkeletonTable executable.  The "Output
                       to screen" check box also affects the destination of
                       the skeleton table.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

  Variables:           If the values for selected variables are to be
                       displayed, this field should contain a comma-separated
                       list of delimited variable names.  See the 'Values' 
                       radio button.

Check boxes for...

  Output to screen:    Whether or not the skeleton table is displayed on the
                       screen in the 'SkeletonTable: standard output' window.
                       If not checked, the skeleton table is written to a
                       file.

  Use FORMAT:          Whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                       writing variable values (if the FORMAT attribute
                       exists and an entry exists for the variable).

  -0.0 to 0.0:         Whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                       library when read from a CDF.

  Page output:         If the skeleton table is being displayed on the screen,
                       whether or not the output is displayed one page (screen)
                       at a time.

  Report info's:       Whether or not informational status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report warnings:     Whether or not warning status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Log progress:        Whether or not progress messages are displayed.

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each CDF.

  About:               Display the library version that is used to create the
                       tool.

Radio buttons for...

  zMode:               The zMode to be used for the CDF.
                          0...zMode is disabled.
                          1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                              variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                          2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                              rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                              are hidden.

  Values:              Data values to be extracted from the CDF.

                           None: Place no variable values in the skeleton table.
                           NRV:  Place only NRV variable values in the skeleton table.
                           RV:   Place only RV variable values in the skeleton table.
                           All:  Place all variable values in the skeleton table.
                           Selected:  Place the values of the variables named in the
                                      'Variables' edit field in the skeleton table.

Buttons for...

  Enter                Causes SkeletonTable to create a skeleton table based
                       on the parameters/qualifiers specified.

  Help                 Causes this online help to be displayed.

  Quit                 Causes SkeletonTable to terminate.  (A skeleton table
                       is not created.)  This button is only present the first
                       time the parameters/qualifiers dialog box is displayed.
