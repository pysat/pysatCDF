CDFconvert is used to convert one or more CDFs.  Conversions can be from
older releases of CDF (eg. Version 2.4 CDFs) to the current release and/or
to change the format, majority, or encoding.  The parameters/qualifiers
dialog box displayed when CDFconvert is 'executed' contains the following
controls.

Edit fields for...

  Source:              The source CDF specification.  This can be either a
                       single CDF file name or a folder/wildcard path in
                       which case all CDFs which match the specification will
                       be converted.  Wildcards are allowed in the CDF name
                       but not in the folder path.  In either case, do not
                       specify an extension.

                       At the end of this field a button labeled "Select" is
                       present.  When selected, a standard input file dialog
                       is displayed from which a single CDF may be selected.

  Destination:         The destination of the converted CDF(s).  This may be
                       a single CDF file name only if the source specification
                       is a single CDF file name.  If the folder paths are the
                       same, then a different CDF name must be specified.  If
                       more than one CDF is being converted, then this must be
                       a folder path (other than the source folder path).
                       This may also be a directory path if only one CDF is
                       being converted.  In any case, do not specify an
                       extension.

                       At the end of this field a button labeled "Select" is
                       present.  When selected, a standard output file dialog
                       is displayed in which a single CDF may be specified.

  Skeleton:            The file name of a skeleton CDF to be used during the
                       conversions (do not enter an extension).  Specifying a
                       skeleton CDF is optional.  The skeleton CDF is used in
                       the following cases...

                         1. If a format for the destination CDF(s) was not
                            specified, then the format of the skeleton CDF
                            will be used.

                         2. If a majority for the destination CDF(s) was not
                            specified, then the majority of the skeleton CDF
                            will be used.

                         3. If an encoding for the destination CDF(s) was not
                            specified, then the encoding of the skeleton CDF
                            will be used.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

  Compression:         Specifies the types of compression to be used for the
                       CDF and/or variables.  <types> consists of a comma-
                       separated list of the following...

                         cdf:<cT>                    CDF's compression.
                         vars:<cT>                   Compression for all
                                                     variables.
                         vars:<cT>:<bF>              Compression for all
                                                     variables with a blocking
                                                     factor specified.
                         vars:<cT>:<bF>:<r%>         Compression for all
                                                     variables with a blocking
                                                     factor and reserve
                                                     percentage specified.
                         var:<name>:<cT>             Compression for one
                                                     particular variable.
                         var:<name>:<cT>:<bF>        Compression for one
                                                     particular variable with
                                                     a blocking factor
                                                     specified.
                         var:<name>:<cT>:<bF>:<r%>   Compression for one
                                                     particular variable with
                                                     a blocking factor and
                                                     reserve percentage
                                                     specified.

                       Where <cT> is one of the following: 'none', 'rle.0',
                       'huff.0', 'ahuff.0', or 'gzip.<level>'; <bF> is a
                       blocking factor; <r%> is a reserve percentage; and
                       <name> is a delimited, case-sensitive variable name
                       with the following syntax:

                             <delim><char1><char2>...<charN><delim>

                       For the 'gzip' compression, <level> must be in the
                       range from '1' (fastest compression) to '9' (best
                       compression).

                       For compressions not specified the compression in
                       the source CDF will be used.  Specifying a variable
                       compression using 'var:' overrides a compression
                       specified with 'vars:'.

  Sparseness:          Specifies the types of sparseness to be used for the
                       variables.  <types> consists of a comma-separated list
                       of the following...

                         vars:<sT>              Sparseness for all variables.
                         var:<name>:<sT>        Sparseness for one particular
                                                variable.

                       Where <sT> is one of the following: 'srecords.no',
                       'srecords.pad', or 'srecords.prev'; and <name> is a
                       delimited, case-sensitive variable name with the
                       following syntax:

                            <delim><char1><char2>...<charN><delim>

                       For sparsenesses not specified the sparseness in
                       the source CDF will be used.  Specifying a variable
                       sparseness using 'var:' overrides a sparseness
                       specified with 'vars:'.

  Display percentages: Whether or not the percentage of a variable's values
                       converted is displayed during the conversion of that

                                                  (unless a skeleton CDF was
                                                   specified).
