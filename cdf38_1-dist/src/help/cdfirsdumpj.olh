CDFirsdump is a utility program used to examine the internal records of a
CDF.  The parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when CDFirsdump is
'executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:               The file name of the CDF to be examined.  At the end of
                     this field a button labeled "Select" is present.  When
                     selected, a standard input file dialog is displayed
                     from which the CDF may be selected.

  Output:            The file name of the output file to which the dump will
                     be written.  At the end of this field a button labeled
                     "Select" is present.  When selected, a standard output
                     file dialog is displayed in which the output file
                     file name may be specified.  If an extension is not
                     specified in this file name, '.dmp' is appended
                     automatically.  If this field is left blank, the output 
                     is displayed on the screen in the "CDFirsdump: standard
                     output" window.

                     is displayed.
