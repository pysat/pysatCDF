CDFdump dumps the data contents in a CDF. It differs the output from CDFexport
by dumping the variables one at a time.

The parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when CDFdump is 'executed'
contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The pathname of the CDF to be dumped.  At the end of
                       this field a button labeled "Select" is present.  When
                       selected, a standard input file dialog is displayed
                       from which the CDF may be selected.

  Output:              The pathname of the output file to which the data contents
                       from a CDF will be written.  At the end of this field a button
                       labeled "Select" is present.  When selected, a standard
                       output file dialog is displayed in which the output
                       file pathname may be specified.  If an extension is not
                       specified in this pathname, '.txt.' is appended
                       automatically.  If this field is left blank, the output
                       is displayed on the screen in the "CDFdump: standard
                       output" window.

  Variables:           The selected variables in the CDF that will be dumped.

  Record Range:        The starting and ending record numbers for variables'
                       data to be dumped.

                       
Check boxes for...

  Use FORMAT:          Whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                       writing variable data (if the FORMAT attribute
                       exists and an entry exists for the variable).

  Dump:                How to dump the file: either metadata, data or all to
                       to dumped.

Buttons for...

  Enter              Causes CDFdump to dump a CDF based on the
                     parameters/qualifiers specified.

  Help               Causes this online help to be displayed.

#ifos mac
  Quit               Causes CDFdump to terminate.  (A CDF is not
                     dumped.)  This button is only present the
                     first time the parameters/qualifiers dialog
                     box is displayed.

#endos
  Cancel             Causes the parameters/qualifiers dialog box to
                     be closed.  (A CDF is not dumped.)
#ifos mac
                     This button is only present after the first time the

Purpose:       CDFdump dumps the data contents in a CDF.

Parameter(s):  <cdf-path>
                  The pathname of the CDF to dump (do not enter an
                  extension).

#ifos vms
               /[NO]FORMAT
#else
               -[no]format
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                  displaying variable values and metadata (if the FORMAT
                  attribute exists and an entry exists for the variable) for
                  a numerical data type (non-char or non-epoch). The default
                  is to use the format. For non-format display, the C's "%g"
                  print format is used, which produces an output in either
                  floating point ("%f") or scientific notation ("%e") form.
                  Note: If the format is not correctly set for the data type,
                  data could be shown in multiple asterisks. In this case,
                  use noformat option is better.

#ifos vms
               /SIGNIFICANT=nn
#else
               -significant nn
#endos
                  Specifies how the floating-point (FP) values are to be
                  displayed. This option is applicable only if FORMAT is to
                  be used, however its FORMAT entry does not exist. The
                  format for showing the FP values, by default, is C's "%g",
                  which might not be good enough, precision-wise, for large
                  values.  With this option, the format becomes "%.nng",
                  where nn is the maximum number of significant digits (>0) 
                  to display.

#ifos vms
               /DUMP=<option>
#else
               -dump <option>
#endos
                  Specifies how the program should produce a dump.
                  Valid options are "all", "data", "nodata", "metadata",
                  "global" and "variable". For "all" option, the default,
                  the output will include detailed information about the
                  CDF, not just only the metadata and variable data. For
                  "data" option, variable data and minimum information
                  about the variable is dumped. For "nodata" option, like
                  "all" option, but the variable data is not dumped.
                  For "metadata" option, output only includes the global 
                  attributes as well as the variable attributes. For "global"
                  option, only the global attributes are dumped. For
                  "variable" option, the variable attributes and entries are
                  displayed.

#ifos vms
               /OUTPUT=<file-path>
#else
               -output <file-path>
#endos
                  Redirects the output to a file.  The file created will
                  be named <file-path> (if <file-path> does not have an
                  extension, '.txt' is appended automatically).  If this
                  qualifier is not specified, the output is displayed at
                  the terminal. If this qualifier is entered as "source",
                  then the source CDF pathname is used for its output 
                  name with its extension of ".cdf" being replaced by ".txt". 

#ifos vms
               /VARS=<[var1,][var2,]...[varN]>
#else
               -vars <[var1,][var2,]...[varN]>
#endos
                  Specifies which variables in the CDF will be dumped. 
                  If not specified, the default, all variables are dumped. 
                  Variable names should be separated by a comma. 

#ifos vms
               /RECORDRANGE=<[rec1,][rec2]>
#else
               -recordrange <[rec1,][rec2]>
#endos
                  While the program, by default, will dump all records
                  from a variable. This option allows specifying only 
                  a range of records, from the starting to the ending 
                  inclusively, to be dumped. The variable record starts 
                  from record one (1).  If only one record number is 
                  provided, that number is assumed to be the starting 
                  record and all records after that will be dumped. 
                  So, "-recordrange 1" (or "/RECORDRANGE=1" for VMS)
                  is the same as the default as all records are dumped. 
                  The record numbers should be separated by a comma.

#ifos vms
               /ABOUT
#else
               -about
#endos
                  Shows the library version that was used to create this tool
                  program.

#ifos vms
               /[NO]HEADER
#else
               -[no]header
#endos
                  Whether to show the 1-line header "Dumping cdf from ...." 
                  from the dump output. No display if "-noheader" is specified.

#ifos vms
               /COL2ROW
#else
               -col2row
#endos
                  By default, the data in a variable record is dumped in the
                  order of its location in the file. For a column-major file,
                  the sequence of data will not be the same as the record
                  indice shows from the row-major based C code for variable of
                  2 or more dimensions. This option will present the
                  column-major data in row-major form that matches data to its
                  record indice.

#ifos vms
               /DETECT
#else
               -detect
#endos
                  This is for file diagnosis. All data components are read and
                  validated from the file. If an invalid item is detected,
                  either from a file access problem or a bad component field,
                  the relevant error messages will be shown, and the program
                  will exit with value one (1). If everything is checked out
                  fine, nothing is reported, no matter what other options are
                  specified, and the program exits with a value of zero (0). 

#ifos vms
               /EPOCH_VIRTUAL
#else
               -epoch_virtual
#endos
                  Whether to show actual epoch values for the epoch-based 
                  "virtual" variables. If specified, the epoch variable's
                  support-typed variables defined in "COMPONENT_0" and
                  "COMPONENT_1" attributes are acquired and their values will
                  be read, computed and displayed. A "(Virtual)" string is
                  added at the end of the variable name for such virtual
                  variable. By default, no data would be displayed for a 
                  virtual epoch variable as it contains no physical records.

#ifos vms
               /ZISO8601
#else
               -ziso8601
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the CDF epoch data should be
                  presented in ISO8601 form with Z. Currently, all epoch
                  data are shown in ISO8601 form without Z.
