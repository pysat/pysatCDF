SkeletonCDF is used to create a skeleton CDF from a skeleton table file.  The
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when SkeletonCDF is 'executed'
contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  Skeleton:            The file name of the skeleton table from which a
                       skeleton CDF will be created.  At the end of this
                       field a button labeled "Select 1" is present.  When
                       selected, a standard input file dialog is displayed
                       from which the skeleton table may be selected. Once
                       a skeleton table file is selected, its extension is
                       removed before its full file name is displayed.

  CDF:                 The file name of the skeleton CDF to be created.  At
                       the end of this field a button labeled "Select 2" is
                       present.  When selected, a standard output file dialog
                       is displayed in which the skeleton CDF file name may
                       be specified.  If this field is left blank, the CDF
                       file name specified in the skeleton table is used.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

Check boxes for...

  Delete existing:     Whether or not an existing CDF is deleted before
                       creating a new CDF (with the same file name).

  Log progress:        Whether or not progress messages are displayed.

  -0.0 to 0.0:         Whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                       library when written to a CDF.

  Report info's:       Whether or not informational status codes from the
                       CDF library should be reported.

  Report warnings:     Whether or not warning status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each CDF.

  Use FILLVAL:         Whether or not entries of the FILLVAL attribute are
                       used to set the pad values for the corresponding
                       variables.  If this qualifier is specified, the
                       FILLVAL attribute must exist and only those
                       variables with an entry for the FILLVAL attribute
                       will be affected.

  Backward:            Whether or not creating the CDF in backward mode (into
                       V2.7 file), instead of the version from the underlying
                       library.

  About:               Display the library version that is used to create the
                       tool.

Radio buttons for...

  zMode:               The zMode to be used with the skeleton table.  If
                       zMode is enabled, zVariables will be created from
                       the definitions in the rVariables section.

                          0...zMode is disabled.
                          1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                              variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                          2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                              rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                              are removed.

Buttons for...

  Enter                Causes SkeletonCDF to create a skeleton CDF based on
                       the parameters/qualifiers specified.

  Help                 Causes this online help to be displayed.

  Quit                 Causes SkeletonCDF to terminate.  (A skeleton CDF is
                       not created.)  This button is only present the first
                       time the parameters/qualifiers dialog box is displayed.
