#title "SelectionWindow, part 1"
This is online help for part 1 of the SelectionWindow.  The SelectionWindow
consists of four parts and is used to select the items/variables to be
exported and/or filtered.

Above the SelectionWindow is the CDFexport window.  It contains the name
of the input CDF, the number of variables and records it contains, and
the CDF compression for an output CDF.  The output CDF compression is
initially set to the input CDF compression.  Below the SelectionWindow is
the KeyDefinitions window displaying the currently available function keys.
Below the KeyDefinitions window is a MessageBuffer window for the display
of errors and instructions as needed.

Part 1 of the SelectionWindow contains columns for the item/variable name,
data specification, dimensionality, variances, and output setting...

   The item/variable column will contain either `Record', `Indices', or
   a variable name.  `Record' allows the record number to be exported
   or filtered.  `Indices' allows the dimension indices to be exported
   or filtered but only in those cases where the dimensionality of each
   variable being exported or filtered is the same.

   The data specification, dimensionality, and variances apply only to
   variables.

   The output setting (`YES' or `no') indicates whether or not the
   item/variable should be exported.  Note that the `Record' and `Indices'
   items cannot be exported to a CDF.


The following functions are supported...

   Modify:   Selects the currently highlighted field for modification.  Note
             that only the `Output' fields can be modified (toggling between
             `YES' and `no').

   Part 2:   Change to part 2 of the SelectionWindow.

   Options:  Displays the OptionMenu.  The OptionMenu allows the modification
             of various settings which affect how items/variables are
             exported.

   Actions:  Displays the ActionMenu.  The ActionMenu allows the various
             exports to be generated (e.g., screen/file listings and new CDF) 
             as well as "block" changes to the fields in the SelectionWindow.

   Reverse:  Reverse the line containing the currently highlighted field with
             the following line (or the first line if at the last line).  The
             order of the lines in the SelectionWindow determines the order
             of the items/variables in the exports.

   Delete:   Deletes (empties) the currently highlighted field.  Note that not
             all fields can be deleted (emptied).

#title "SelectionWindow, part 2"
This is online help for part 2 of the SelectionWindow.  The SelectionWindow
consists of four parts and is used to select the items/variables to be
exported and/or filtered.

Above the SelectionWindow is the CDFexport window.  It contains the name
of the input CDF, the number of variables and records it contains, and
the CDF compression for an output CDF.  The output CDF compression is
initially set to the input CDF compression.  Below the SelectionWindow is
the KeyDefinitions window displaying the currently available function keys.
Below the KeyDefinitions window is a MessageBuffer window for the display
of errors and instructions as needed.

Part 2 of the SelectionWindow contains columns for the item/variable name,
minimum and maximum filter values, and filter setting...

   The item/variable column will contain either `Record', `Indices', or
   a variable name.  `Record' allows the record number to be exported
   or filtered.  `Indices' allows the dimension indices to be exported
   or filtered but only in those cases where the dimensionality of each
   variable being exported or filtered is the same.

   The minimum filter value for an item/variable is the minimum value
   to be output.  Whether the filter for an item/variable is inclusive
   or exclusive (as described below) will affect how this value is used.

   The maximum filter value for an item/variable is the maximum value
   to be output.  Whether the filter for an item/variable is inclusive
   or exclusive (as described below) will affect how this value is used.

   The filter setting indicates whether or not the item/variable should be
   filtered.  Depending on whether or not exclusive filters are allowed,
   one of the following values will be shown...

      Exclusive filters allowed...

        YeS    Put an inclusive filter on the item/variable.
        yEs    Put an exclusive filter on the item/variable.
        no     Do not filter the item/variable.

      Exclusive filters not allowed...

        YES    Put an inclusive filter on the item/variable.
        no     Do not filter the item/variable.

   Inclusive filters pass the minimum and maximum values.  Exclusive filters
   do not pass the minimum and maximum values - only the values that are
   greater than the minimum and less than the maximum will pass.  Whether or
   not exclusive filters are allowed can be specified when CDFexport is
   executed (if the default mode is not what is desired).

   If the filter setting is enclosed in parenthesis, then overall filtering
   is currently disabled.  Overall filtering must be enabled for any filtering
   to occur.  Overall filtering is selected on the OptionMenu.


The following functions are supported...

   Modify:   Selects the currently highlighted field for modification.  If
             a minimum or maximum field is highlighted, a prompt will be
             displayed for the new minimum or maximum value.  If a `Filter'
             field is highlighted, the value will be cycled through the
             possible values described above (and overall filtering will be
             enabled if it was disabled).

   Part 3:   Change to part 3 of the SelectionWindow.

   Options:  Displays the OptionMenu.  The OptionMenu allows the modification
             of various settings which affect how items/variables are
             exported.

   Actions:  Displays the ActionMenu.  The ActionMenu allows the various
             exports to be generated (e.g., screen/file listings and new CDF) 
             as well as "block" changes to the fields in the SelectionWindow.

   Reverse:  Reverse the line containing the currently highlighted field with
             the following line (or the first line if at the last line).  The
             order of the lines in the SelectionWindow determines the order
             of the items/variables in the exports.

   Delete:   Deletes (empties) the currently highlighted field.  Note that not
             all fields can be deleted (emptied).

#title "SelectionWindow, part 3"
This is online help for part 3 of the SelectionWindow.  The SelectionWindow
consists of four parts and is used to select the items/variables to be
exported and/or filtered.

Above the SelectionWindow is the CDFexport window.  It contains the name
of the input CDF, the number of variables and records it contains, and
the CDF compression for an output CDF.  The output CDF compression is
initially set to the input CDF compression.  Below the SelectionWindow is
the KeyDefinitions window displaying the currently available function keys.
Below the KeyDefinitions window is a MessageBuffer window for the display
of errors and instructions as needed.

Part 3 of the SelectionWindow contains columns for the item/variable name,
fill value, monotonicity, format, and width...

   The item/variable column will contain either `Record', `Indices', or
   a variable name.  `Record' allows the record number to be exported
   or filtered.  `Indices' allows the dimension indices to be exported
   or filtered but only in those cases where the dimensionality of each
   variable being exported or filtered is the same.

   The fill value for a variable is the value which was used to indicate
   missing/invalid data.  When filtering a variable's values, a value equal
   to the fill value will always pass the filters regardless of whether or
   not the value is within the minimum/maximum filter range.

   The monotonicity field indicates if a variable is strictly increasing,
   decreasing, or neither.  Monotonicity only applies to variables which
   vary along just one dimension.  Records are considered another dimension
   when dealing with monotonicity.  Correctly setting the monotonicity of
   a variable being filtered can significantly improve the performance of
   CDFexport.  The following monotonicities are possible...

      Increase      The variable's values strictly increase along the one
                    dimension.
      Decrease      The variable's values strictly decrease along the one
                    dimension.
      False         The variable is not monotonic.
      ?             The variable's monotonicity is unknown.
      (n/a)         The variable varies along zero or more than one dimension.

   The format field contains a C, Fortran, or custom EPOCH format (or may
   be empty).

      For variables not of type CDF_EPOCH, the C or Fortran format will be
      used when encoding the variable's values in a screen or file listing.
      If this field is empty, a default format will be used depending on the
      variable's data type.

      The setting of the EPOCH style on the OptionMenu determines how this
      format will be used. For variables of type CDF_EPOCH, a custom EPOCH
      format may also be specified as described in the documentation for
      `EPOCHx'.  If the EPOCH style is the standard style or one of the
      alternate styles, this format is ignored and will be enclosed in
      parenthesis.  Otherwise, the C, Fortran, or custom EPOCH format will
      be used as appropriate (unless this field is empty in which case a
      default format will be used).

   The width field contains the number of characters to be used for each
   variable value in a screen or file listing.  This width is generally
   initially set based on the format field.  Modifying this width allows
   the columns of a listing to be adjusted as desired.


The following functions are supported...

   Modify:   Selects the currently highlighted field for modification.  If
             a fill value, format, or width field is highlighted, a prompt
             will be displayed for the new value.  If a `monotonicity' field
             is highlighted, the value will be cycled through the possible
             values described above.

   Part 4:   Change to part 4 of the SelectionWindow.

   Options:  Displays the OptionMenu.  The OptionMenu allows the modification
             of various settings which affect how items/variables are
             exported.

   Actions:  Displays the ActionMenu.  The ActionMenu allows the various
             exports to be generated (e.g., screen/file listings and new CDF) 
             as well as "block" changes to the fields in the SelectionWindow.

   Reverse:  Reverse the line containing the currently highlighted field with
             the following line (or the first line if at the last line).  The
             order of the lines in the SelectionWindow determines the order
             of the items/variables in the exports.

        Vertical listing, variables having different dimensionalities...

           A variable's values at a particular record are displayed one
           per line according to the selected majority.  The number of
           lines corresponding to a record depends on the variable having
           the most values per record.  Because one or more of the other

  Majority: [row|column|input]

     When exporting to a CDF, if a row-major, column-major, or input-major
     CDF should be created.  When exporting to a screen/file listing, if the
     indices/values should be incremented with row-majority, column-majority,
     or input-majority.  When searching for a variable value (when "walking"
     through a CDF), whether to increment the indices with row-majority,
     column-majority, or input-majority.

     Input-majority is the majority of the input CDF.

  Show filtered lines: [YES|no]

     When exporting to a screen/file listing, whether or not the lines which
     are filtered out are shown.  A value filtered out on a listing is shown
     as dashes (e.g., `--------').  If a value being filtered out will cause
     an entire line (or set of lines) of a listing to be filtered out depends
     on the type of listing as follows...

        Vertical listing, variables having the same dimensionality...

           If a value on a line fails a filter, then the entire line will be
           filtered out.

        Vertical listing, variables having different dimensionalities...

           If a scalar variable fails a filter, then all of the lines for the
           corresponding record will be filtered out.

        Horizontal listing...

           If a scalar variable fails a filter, then the entire line will be
           filtered out.

     These listing types are described above.

  Item/variable spacing: [0,1,...]

     When exporting to a screen/file listing, the number of spaces between
     items/variables.

  Delete existing CDF: [YES|no]

     Whether or not an existing CDF should be deleted if a new CDF is being
     created with the same name.

  Preallocate records: [YES|no]

     Whether or not the variable records for a new CDF being created should
     be preallocated.  This takes additional time but results in a CDF that
     contains less indexing overhead.

  Display heading: [YES|no]

     Whether or not a heading line is included in a text file listing.

CDFexport allows the contents of a CDF to be exported to a variety of formats.
A simple mode is available that provides a more limited functionality as
described below for the `Simple' checkbox.  The parameters/qualifiers dialog
box displayed when CDFexport is `executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The specification of the CDF(s) to be exported.  Do
                       not enter an extension.  This may be either a single
                       CDF pathname or a folder/wildcard path.  Wildcards are
                       allowed in the CDF name but not in the folder path.

                       At the end of this field a button labeled "Select" is
                       present.  When "Select" is selected, a standard input
                       file dialog is displayed from which the CDF may be
                       selected.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: `d' for the
                       dotCDF file, `s' for the staging file, and `c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, `200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the `d'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases
                       (e.g.,`200,100s').  Note that not all of the file 
                       types must be specified.  Those not specified will 
                       receive a default cache size.

Purpose:       CDFexport allows the contents of a CDF to be exported to a
               variety of formats.

Modes:         CDFexport can be executed in one of several modes.  Normally
               the full functionality of CDFexport is available in an
               interactive mode.  A simple mode is available that provides
               a more limited functionality as described for the `simple'
               qualifier below.  A batch mode is available that causes
               CDFexport to generate its output based on the parameters
               specified in a settings file (as described for the `batch'
               and `settings' qualifiers below).  Note that CDFexport must
               be executed interactively to create a settings file.

               CDFexport is normally executed interactively by specifying:

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT <qualifiers/options> <input-cdf(s)-specification>
#else
                  cdfexport <qualifiers/options> <input-cdf(s)-specification>
#endos

               To use batch mode specify:

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT/BATCH=TEXT
                           /SETTINGS=<file>
                           /TEXT=<file>
#else
                  cdfexport -batch text
                            -settings <file>
                            -text <file>
#endos
                            <other-qualifiers/options>             [optional]
                            <input-cdf-pathname>                   [required]

                  or,

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT/BATCH=CDF
                           /SETTINGS=<file>
                           /CDF=<output-cdf-pathname>
#else
                  cdfexport -batch cdf
                            -settings <file>
                            -cdf <output-cdf-pathname>
#endos
                            <other-qualifiers/options>             [optional]
                            <input-cdf-pathname>                   [required]

               To use simple mode interactively specify:

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT/SIMPLE
#else
                  cdfexport -simple
#endos
                            <other-qualifiers/options>             [optional]
                            <input-cdf(s)-specification>

               To use simple mode and batch mode specify:

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT/SIMPLE
                           /BATCH=TEXT
                           /SETTINGS=<file>
                           /TEXT=<file>
#else
                  cdfexport -simple
                            -batch text
                            -settings <file>
                            -text <file>

                            <other-qualifiers/options>             [optional]
                            <input-cdf-pathname>                   [required]

                  or,

#ifos vms
                  CDFEXPORT/SIMPLE
                           /BATCH=CDF
                           /SETTINGS=<file>
                           /CDF=<output-cdf-pathname>

                  cdfexport -simple
                            -batch cdf
                            -settings <file>
                            -cdf <output-cdf-pathname>
#endos
                            <other-qualifiers/options>             [optional]
                            <input-cdf-pathname>                   [required]

Parameter(s):  <cdf-spec>
                  The specification of the CDF(s) from which to export.  Do
                  not specify an extension.  This may be either a single
                  CDF pathname or a directory/wildcard path.  Wildcards are
                  allowed in the CDF name but not in the directory path.  If
                  the `prompt' qualifier is used, <cdf-spec> will appear as
                  the initial specification.  If this parameter is omitted,
                  the `prompt' qualifier must be specified and the initial
                  specification will be the current directory.  If batch mode
                  is selected, this parameter must be a single CDF (and the
                  `prompt' qualifier will be ignored).

#ifos vms
Qualifier(s):  /[NO]SIMPLE
#else
Qualifier(s):  -[no]simple
#endos
                  Specifies if a simplified version of CDFexport should be
                  executed.  The following conditions apply to simple mode:

                     - Only text listings can be generated (to the
                       screen or a file).
                     - No filtering is available.
                     - When listing to a text file, FORMAT attribute
                       entries are ignored and standard formats are
                       used instead.
                     - Only a limited set of the options for the
                       `initial' qualifier may be specified.
                     - zMode/2 is used by default.
                     - Horizontal listings are created by default.

#ifos vms
               /BATCH=<mode>
#else
               -batch <mode>
#endos
                  Specifies if CDFexport should execute in a non-interactive,
                  batch mode.  The <mode> option may be either "text" to
                  generate a text file listing or "cdf" to output to a new
                  CDF.  A settings file will be used if one exists with the
                  default name in the current directory or is explicitly
                  specified with the `settings' qualifier.  The settings file
                  contains the parameters necessary to specify how the output
                  CDF or text file should be generated.  If a settings file is
                  not available, default parameters will be used.  CDFexport
                  must be used interactively to create a settings file.

#ifos vms

#else
               -[no]prompt
#endos
                  If this qualifier is specified along with the <cdf-spec>
                  parameter, a prompt for the CDF(s) from which to export
                  will be issued with <cdf-spec> as the initial specification.
                  If this qualifier is specified without the <cdf-spec>
                  parameter, the current directory will be the initial
                  specification.  If this qualifier is not specified, the
                  <cdf-spec> parameter is required and is automatically
                  opened.  Note that the `prompt' qualifier is ignored if
                  batch mode is selected.

#ifos vms

#else
               -cdf <path>
#endos
                  Specifies an output CDF pathname to be used when exporting
                  to a CDF in batch mode.  Do not include an extension.  When
                  executing interactively this pathname will initially appear
                  at the output CDF prompt.  If this qualifier is not
                  specified, the default CDF name is "default" (in the current
                  directory).

                  Specifies a pathname to be used when exporting to a text
                  file listing in batch mode.  When executing interactively
                  this pathname will initially appear at the text file prompt.
                  If this qualifier is not specified, the default text file

                  Specifies a settings file pathname to be used when executing
                  in batch mode.  When executing interactively this pathname
                  will initially appear at the settings file prompt when
                  saving/restoring the current settings.  The default settings
                  file is "simple.set" if executing in simple mode and
                  "export.set" otherwise (with each being in the current
                  directory). Settings file provides settings to, among other
                  things, control whether and how the variables should be
                  exported and filtered. Variables in the source CDF but not 
                  in the settings file, by default, will be exported. If 
                  settings file is not provided, the default settings are used,

                     [no]output             Whether or not each item/variable
                                            is initially output.

                     [no]delete*            The initial setting on the

                                            in a text file listing. A "#" sign
                                            is added to each heading line if
                                            poundedheading is chosen.

                     single | multi*        Whether single-file or multi-

                                            OptionMenu.

                     host | network*        Whether host-encoded or network-
                                            encoded CDFs are selected on the
                                            OptionMenu.

                     row | column |         Whether row-major, column-major,
                     (neither)*             or input-major CDFs/listings are
                                            selected on the OptionMenu.
                                            Input-major is the majority of
                                            the input CDF (and is requested
                                            by specifying neither `row' nor

                     horizontal | vertical* Whether horizontal or vertical
                                            listings are selected on the
                                            OptionMenu.

                  Note that the options selected for the OptionMenu can be
                  changed at any time after the CDF has been opened (unless
                  simple mode is being used which doesn't support the
                  OptionMenu).  If this qualifier is not specified, each of
                  these options has a default setting (dependent upon whether
                  or not simple mode is being used).  These default settings
                  are also used for options not specified with this qualifier.

                  *: These option fields, if provided, will be saved in the
                     settings file when "Save settings" action menu is chosen.

                  Specifies which zMode should be used for CDFs being exported
                  from.  <mode> may be one of the following...

                     0       Indicates that zMode is disabled.
                     1       Indicates that zMode/1 should be used (the
                             dimension variances of rVariables will be
                             preserved).
                     2       Indicates that zMode/2 should be used (the
                             dimensions of rVariables having a variance
                             of NOVARY (false) are hidden.

#ifos vms

#endos
                  The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the CDF's
                  dotCDF file, staging file, and compression scratch file.
                  If this qualifier is absent, default cache sizes chosen by
                  the CDF library are used.  The cache sizes are specified
                  with a comma-separated list of <number><type> pairs where
                  <number> is the number of cache buffers and <type> is the
                  type of file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: `d' for
                  the dotCDF file, `s' for the staging file, and `c' for the
                  compression scratch file.  For example, `200d,100s'
                  specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and 100
                  cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF file cache
                  size can also be specified without the `d' <type> for
                  compatibility with older CDF releases (e.g., `200,100s').
                  Note that not all of the file types must be specified.
                  Those not specified will receive a default cache size.

                  comma-separated list of zero or more of the following
                  symbols: `errors', `warnings', or `informationals'. Note
                  that these symbols can be truncated (e.g., `e', `w', or

                  Specifies whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the
                  CDF library when read from or written to a CDF.  -0.0 is
                  an illegal floating point value on VAXes and DEC Alphas
                  running OpenVMS.

#ifos vms

#else
               -[include | exclude] "<vars> | varsfile=<file>"
#endos
                  Includes or excludes only those specified variables
                  in the CDF for export. The variables can be specified
                  in "vars", a comma-separated variable list. Alternatively,
                  if the list gets too long, a text file, containing
                  the variables, one variable per line, can be used.
                  The text file option is identified by "varsfile". This is
                  a simple and easier way of exporting variables without
                  settings file, nor data filtering. A warning is shown if
                  a variable(s) specified is not in the CDF. Record numbers
                  and indices will be displayed, if applicable, for exporting
                  to text. "include" and "exclude" are mutually exclusive.
                  This option and "settings" option are also mutually
                  exclusive. As "settings" is not allowed, the default
                  settings, if not overridden, will be used for the exports.
                  This option works in the batch mode. 

#ifos vms
               /[EPOCHRANGE | RECORDRANGE]=(<ranges>)
#else
               -[epochrange | recordrange] "<ranges>"
#endos
                  Selects a range of variable data for exporting from a CDF.
                  The range can be based on epoch, specified by "epochrange"
                  or record, by "recordrange". "ranges" should be a pair of
                  values for starting and ending value, separated by a comma.
                  Epoch includes types of CDF_EPOCH, CDF_EPOCH16 and
                  CDF_TIME_TT2000. For the starting and ending epoch, they
                  must be one of the following format pairs:
                  "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.msc" or "dd-mom-yyyy hh:mm:ss.msc" for
                  CDF_EPOCH, "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmuuunnnppp" or
                  "dd-mom-yyyy hh:mm:ss.mmm.uuu.nnn.ppp" for CDF_EPOCH16, and
                  "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.mmmuuunnn" for CDF_TIME_TT2000.
                  All date fields should be numerical. For the record numbers,
                  they start from record one (1). If no data is found from
                  the exported variables, nothing is outputted. "epochrange"
                  and "recordrange" are mutually exclusive. This option
                  works in the batch mode.

#ifos vms

#else

#endos
                  A batch mode option that uses the settings file to control
                  what variables and their order for export. CDFexport, by
                  default, exports variables in a sequence based on their
                  order in the source CDF file, no matter how settings file is
                  defined. This option requires the settings file to be
                  present, either specified at the command line or the default
                  file "export.set" (or "simple.set" for simple mode) residing
                  in the current directory. Only those variables specified in
                  settings file are considered for export. The file also
                  dictates the output sequence of variables in the export.
