CDFcompare displays the differences between two CDFs.  More than one pair of
CDFs may be compared.  The parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when
CDFcompare is 'executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF1:                The pathname of the first CDF specification.
  CDF2:                The pathname of the second CDF specification.
                          The two CDF specifications to be compared.  At the
                          end of each field a button labeled "Select" is
                          present.  When selected, a standard input file
                          dialog is displayed from which a single CDF may be
                          selected.  Note that folders/wildcard specifications
                          may also be specified in these fields.  (Wildcards
                          are allowed in CDF names but not folder names).

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

                       should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Log progress:        Whether or not progress messages are displayed.

  Display percentages: Whether or not the percentage of a variable's values
                       compared is displayed during the comparison of that
                       variable.  Progress message logging must also be
                       enabled.

  Display locations:   Whether or not the locations of variable value
                       differences are displayed.  The locations are displayed
                       in the form...
                           <record-number>:[<index1>,<index2>,...,<indexN>]

  Display values:      Whether or not the values are displayed when a
                       difference is detected (between attribute entries
                       and variable values).  Note that for variable values
                       to be displayed, the display of the locations of the
                       differences must also be enabled (see the "Display
                       locations" check box).

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each comparison of two CDFs.

                            1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                                variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                            2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                                rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                                are hidden.

Purpose:      CDFcompare displays the differences in two CDFs.  More than
              one pair of CDFs may be compared.

Parameter(s): <cdf-spec-1>
              <cdf-spec-2>
                  The specifications of the CDFs to be compared (do not
                  enter extensions).  These can be either a pathname
                  specifying a single CDF or a directory/wildcard path
                  specifying more than one CDF.  Wildcards are allowed in
                  the CDF name but not in the directory path.  The available
                  wildcards are similar to those on the operating system
                  being used.

                  If two directory/wildcard paths are specified, all of the
                  CDFs with matching names will be compared.  If a CDF
                  pathname and a directory/wildcard path are specified,
                  the CDF specified will be compared with the CDF in the
                  directory/wildcard path having the same name.  If two CDF
                  pathnames are specified, the CDFs are compared (this is
                  the only way to compare two CDFs having different names).

#ifos vms
              /ZMODES=(<mode1>,<mode2>)
#else
              -zmodes "<mode1>,<mode2>"
#endos
                  Specifies the zModes which should be used with the
                  CDF(s) being compared.  <mode1> applies to the first CDF
                  specification and <mode2> applies to the second CDF
                  specification.  The zModes may each be one of the
                  following...

                     0       Indicates that zMode is disabled.
                     1       Indicates that zMode/1 should be used (the
                             dimension variances of rVariables will be
                             preserved).
                     2       Indicates that zMode/2 should be used (the

#else
               -[no]neg2posfp0
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the
                  CDF library when read from a CDF.  -0.0 is an illegal
                  floating point value on VAXes and DEC Alphas running OpenVMS.

                  in the form...
                       <record-number>:[<index1>,<index2>,...,<indexN>]

#ifos vms

#else
               -[no]value
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the values are displayed when
                  a difference is detected (between attribute entries and
                  variable values).  Note that for variable values to be
                  displayed, the display of the locations of the differences
                  must also be enabled.

#ifos vms

#else
               -[no]format
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used to
                  display data values when a difference is detected
                  (between attribute entries and variable values). Note that
                  use of the FORMAT attribute for data display is the default,
                  if existence, sometimes it might not have the detailed
                  precision for the floating-points to show the differences.
                  Even the 'noformat' option could not always show the very 
                  minor differences between floating-point values as the C's
                  "%g" format is used.   

#ifos vms
               /REPORT=(<types>)
#else
               -report "<types>"
#endos
                  Specifies the types of return status codes from the CDF
                  library which should be reported/displayed.  <types> is
                  a comma-separated list of zero or more of the following
                  symbols: 'errors', 'warnings', or 'informationals'.  Note
                  that these symbols can be truncated (eg. 'e', 'w', and
                  'i').

#ifos vms
               /CACHE=(<sizes>)
#else
               -cache "<sizes>"
#endos
                  The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the CDF's
                  dotCDF file, staging file, and compression scratch file.
                  If this qualifier is absent, default cache sizes chosen by
                  the CDF library are used.  The cache sizes are specified
                  with a comma-separated list of <number><type> pairs where
                  <number> is the number of cache buffers and <type> is the
                  type of file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for
                  the dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for the
                  compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                  specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and 100
                  cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF file cache
                  size can also be specified without the 'd' <type> for
                  compatibility with older CDF releases (eg. '200,100s').
                  Note that not all of the file types must be specified.
                  Those not specified will receive a default cache size.

#ifos vms
              /TOLERANCE=(<F:tolerance1>,<D:tolerance2>)
#else
              -tolerance "<f:tolerance1>,<d:tolerance2>"
#endos
                  Specifies the tolerance(s) that is used to check the equality 
                  between two single/double-precision floating-point values. 
                  The default option is no tolerance. It means that two values 
                  are considered unequal if their data representations in
                  common encoding are different. If a tolerance(s) is
                  provided, it is used against the difference between the two
                  unequal values. If their difference is within the tolerance,
                  they are considered to be technically equal. Either one or
                  both of these two tolerances, one for 4-byte
                  single-precision floating-point data and the other for
                  8-byte double-precision floating-point data, respectively,
                  can be specified. 

                  If the given tolerance is positive, the following formula is 
                  used to check their equality:
                     abs(value1-value2) > tolerance

                  If the given tolerance is negative, the following formula is
                  applied:
                  abs(value1-value2) > abs(tolerance)*max(abs(value1),abs(value2))

                  tolerance1, used for the single-precision floating-point data,
                  may be in one of the two forms: "default" or a value. Using 
                  "default" indicates that the default value, 1.0E-06, is used
                  for the tolerance check for any single-precision
                  floating-point data.  Or, the specified value is used for
                  the tolerance check. This field applies to data types of
                  CDF_REAL4 and CDF_FLOAT.  "def" can be used to substitute
                  for "default".

                  tolerance2, used for the double-precision floating-point data,
                  may be in one of the two forms: "default" or a value. Using 
                  "default" indicates that the default value, 1.0E-09, is used
                  for the tolerance check for any double-precision
                  floating-point data.  Or, the specified value is used for
                  the tolerance check.  This field applies to data types of
                  CDF_REAL8, CDF_DOUBLE and CDF_EPOCH. "default" can be
                  abbreviated as "def".
