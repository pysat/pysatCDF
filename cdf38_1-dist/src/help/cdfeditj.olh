CDFedit allows full screen browsing/editing of a CDF.  The
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when CDFedit is
'executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The specification of the CDF(s) to be edited (do not
                       enter an extension).  This may be either a single CDF
                       file name or a folder/wildcard path.  Wildcards are
                       allowed in the CDF name but not in the folder path.
                       If "Prompt for CDF" is specified (see below), this
                       specification will appear as the initial specification
                       at the prompt.  If this parameter is omitted, "Prompt
                       for CDF" must be specified (and the initial
                       specification at the prompt will be the current
                       directory).

                       At the end of this field buttons labeled "Select" and
                       "New" are present.  When "Select" is selected, a
                       standard input file dialog is displayed from which the
                       CDF may be selected.  Use this when an existing CDF is
                       to be edited.  When "New" is selected, a standard
                       output file dialog is displayed in which a CDF may be
                       specified.  Use this when a CDF is to be created.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

Check boxes for...

  Browse only:         Whether or not a browsing mode is desired.  When
                       browsing, the creation, modification, or deletion
                       of a CDF is not allowed.

  Use FORMAT:          Whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                       writing variable values (if the FORMAT attribute
                       exists and an entry exists for the variable).

  -0.0 to 0.0:         Whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                       library when read from or written to a CDF.

  Prompt for CDF:      Whether or not a prompt is issued for the CDF(s)
                       specification.  When enabled, the prompt will be
                       issued both at program startup and after editing
                       the current CDF(s) specification (at which point a
                       new CDF(s) specification may be specified).  If a
                       CDF(s) specification is entered in the "CDF" edit
                       field along with this qualifier, the CDF(s)
                       specification will appear at the prompt (otherwise,
                       the current directory will appear at the prompt).

  Report info's:       Whether or not informational status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report warnings:     Whether or not warning status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each editing session.

  Display gEntries with gAttributes:

                       Specifies whether or not gEntries are displayed with
                       the gAttributes or on separate menus (with one menu
                       per gAttribute).

  Display rEntries/zEntries with vAttributes:

                       Specifies whether or not rEntries/zEntries are
                       displayed with the vAttributes or on separate menus
                       (with one menu per vAttribute).

  About:               Display the library version that is used to create the
                       tool.

Radio buttons for...

  zMode:               The zMode to be used for a CDF.
                           0...zMode is disabled.
                           1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                               variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                           2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                               rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                               are hidden.

Buttons for...

  Enter                Causes CDFedit to edit CDF(s) based on the
                       parameters/qualifiers specified.

  Help                 Causes this online help to be displayed.

  Quit                 Causes CDFedit to terminate.  (A CDF[s] specification
                       is not edited.)
