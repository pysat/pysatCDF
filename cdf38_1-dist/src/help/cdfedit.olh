CDFedit allows full screen browsing/editing of a CDF.  The
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when CDFedit is
'executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:                 The specification of the CDF(s) to be edited (do not
                       enter an extension).  This may be either a single CDF
                       pathname or a folder/wildcard path.  Wildcards are
                       allowed in the CDF name but not in the folder path.
                       If "Prompt for CDF" is specified (see below), this
                       specification will appear as the initial specification
                       at the prompt.  If this parameter is omitted, "Prompt
                       for CDF" must be specified (and the initial
                       specification at the prompt will be the current
                       directory).

                       At the end of this field buttons labeled "Select" and
                       "New" are present.  When "Select" is selected, a
                       standard input file dialog is displayed from which the
                       CDF may be selected.  Use this when an existing CDF is
                       to be edited.  When "New" is selected, a standard
                       output file dialog is displayed in which a CDF may be
                       specified.  Use this when a CDF is to be created.

  Cache sizes:         The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the
                       CDF's dotCDF file, staging file, and compression
                       scratch file.  If this field is left blank, default
                       cache sizes chosen by the CDF library are used.
                       The cache sizes are specified with a comma-separated
                       list of <number><type> pairs where <number> is the
                       number of cache buffers and <type> is the type of
                       file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for the
                       dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for
                       the compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                       specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and
                       100 cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF
                       file cache size can also be specified without the 'd'
                       <type> for compatibility with older CDF releases (eg.
                       '200,100s').  Note that not all of the file types must
                       be specified.  Those not specified will receive a
                       default cache size.

Check boxes for...

  Browse only:         Whether or not a browsing mode is desired.  When
                       browsing, the creation, modification, or deletion
                       of a CDF is not allowed.

  Use FORMAT:          Whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used when
                       writing variable values (if the FORMAT attribute
                       exists and an entry exists for the variable).

  -0.0 to 0.0:         Whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                       library when read from or written to a CDF.

  Prompt for CDF:      Whether or not a prompt is issued for the CDF(s)
                       specification.  When enabled, the prompt will be
                       issued both at program startup and after editing
                       the current CDF(s) specification (at which point a
                       new CDF(s) specification may be specified).  If a
                       CDF(s) specification is entered in the "CDF" edit
                       field along with this qualifier, the CDF(s)
                       specification will appear at the prompt (otherwise,
                       the current directory will appear at the prompt).

  Report info's:       Whether or not informational status codes from the CDF
                       library should be reported.

  Report warnings:     Whether or not warning status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Report errors:       Whether or not error status codes from the CDF library
                       should be reported.

  Display statistics:  Whether or not caching statistics are displayed at the
                       end of each editing session.

  Display gEntries with gAttributes:

                       Specifies whether or not gEntries are displayed with
                       the gAttributes or on separate menus (with one menu
                       per gAttribute).

  Display rEntries/zEntries with vAttributes:

                       Specifies whether or not rEntries/zEntries are
                       displayed with the vAttributes or on separate menus
                       (with one menu per vAttribute).

Radio buttons for...

  zMode:               The zMode to be used for a CDF.
                           0...zMode is disabled.
                           1...zMode/1 should be used.  The dimension
                               variances of the rVariables will be preserved.
                           2...zMode/2 should be used.  The dimensions of
                               rVariables having a variance of NOVARY (false)
                               are hidden.

Purpose:       CDFedit allows full screen browsing/editing of a CDF.

Parameter(s):  <cdf-spec>
                  The specification of the CDF(s) to edit (do not specify
                  an extension).  This may be either a single CDF pathname
                  or a directory/wildcard path.  Wildcards are allowed in
                  the CDF name but not in the directory path.  If the prompt
                  qualifier is used, <cdf-spec> will appear as the initial
                  specification at the prompt.  If this parameter is omitted
                  the prompt qualifier must be specified (and the initial
                  specification at the prompt will be the current directory).

#ifos vms
Qualifier(s):  /[NO]BROWSE
#else
Qualifier(s):  -[no]browse
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not a browsing mode is desired.
                  When browsing, the creation, modification, or deletion
                  of a CDF is not allowed.

#ifos vms
               /ZMODE=<mode>
#else
               -zmode <mode>
#endos

                  Specifies which zMode should be used for opened and newly
                  created CDFs.  <mode> may be one of the following...

                     0       Indicates that zMode is disabled.
                     1       Indicates that zMode/1 should be used (the
                             dimension variances of rVariables will be
                             preserved).
                     2       Indicates that zMode/2 should be used (the
                             dimensions of rVariables having a variance
                             of NOVARY (false) are hidden.

#ifos vms
               /[NO]FORMAT
#else
               -[no]format
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the FORMAT attribute is used
                  when displaying variable and attribute values (if the
                  FORMAT attribute exists and an entry exists for the
                  variable) for a numerical data type (non-char or non-epoch).
                  The default is to use the format.

#ifos vms
               /[NO]PROMPT
#else
               -[no]prompt
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not a prompt is issued for the
                  CDF(s) specification.  When enabled, the prompt will
                  be issued both at program startup and after editing
                  the current CDF(s) specification (at which point a
                  new CDF(s) specification may be specified).  If a
                  CDF(s) specification is entered at the command line
                  along with this qualifier, the CDF(s) specification
                  will appear at the prompt (otherwise, the current
                  directory will appear at the prompt).

#ifos vms
               /[NO]NEG2POSFP0
#else
               -[no]neg2posfp0
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not -0.0 is converted to 0.0 by the CDF
                  library when read from a CDF.  -0.0 is an illegal floating
                  point value on VAXes and DEC Alphas running OpenVMS.

#ifos vms
               /REPORT=(<types>)
#else
               -report "<types>"
#endos
                  Specifies the types of return status codes from the CDF
                  library which should be reported/displayed.  <types> is
                  a comma-separated list of zero or more of the following
                  symbols: 'errors', 'warnings', or 'informationals'.  Note
                  that these symbols can be truncated (eg. 'e', 'w', and 'i').

#ifos vms
               /CACHE=(<sizes>)
#else
               -cache "<sizes>"
#endos
                  The number of 512-byte buffers to be used for the CDF's
                  dotCDF file, staging file, and compression scratch file.
                  If this qualifier is absent, default cache sizes chosen by
                  the CDF library are used.  The cache sizes are specified
                  with a comma-separated list of <number><type> pairs where
                  <number> is the number of cache buffers and <type> is the
                  type of file.  The file <type>'s are as follows: 'd' for
                  the dotCDF file, 's' for the staging file, and 'c' for the
                  compression scratch file.  For example, '200d,100s'
                  specifies 200 cache buffers for the dotCDF file and 100
                  cache buffers for the staging file.  The dotCDF file cache
                  size can also be specified without the 'd' <type> for
                  compatibility with older CDF releases (eg. '200,100s').
                  Note that not all of the file types must be specified.
                  Those not specified will receive a default cache size.
