CDFirsdump is a utility program used to examine the internal records of a
CDF.  The variable data record is displayed in hex form. The 
parameters/qualifiers dialog box displayed when CDFirsdump is
'executed' contains the following controls.

Edit fields for...

  CDF:               The pathname of the CDF to be examined.  At the end of
                     this field a button labeled "Select" is present.  When
                     selected, a standard input file dialog is displayed
                     from which the CDF may be selected.

  Output:            The pathname of the output file to which the dump will
                     be written.  At the end of this field a button labeled
                     "Select" is present.  When selected, a standard output
                     file dialog is displayed in which the output file
                     pathname may be specified.  If an extension is not
                     specified in this pathname, '.dmp' is appended
                     automatically.  If this field is left blank, the output 
                     is displayed on the screen in the "CDFirsdump: standard
                     output" window.

Check boxes for...

  Page output:       If the dump is being displayed on the screen, whether
                     or not the output is displayed one page (screen) at a
                     time.

  Show summary:      Whether or not a summary of the CDFirsdump is displayed.

Radio buttons for...

  Brief dump:        Perform a brief dump.

  Full dump:         Perform a full dump.

Buttons for...

  Enter              Causes CDFirsdump to dump a CDF based on the
                     parameters/qualifiers specified.

#ifos mac
  Quit               Causes CDFirsdump to terminate.  (A CDFirsdump is not
                     performed.)  This button is only present the
                     first time the parameters/qualifiers dialog box
                     is displayed.

#endos
  Cancel             Causes the parameters/qualifiers dialog box to be
                     closed.  (A CDFirsdump is not performed.)

Purpose:       CDFirsdump dumps Internal Records (IRs) in a CDF.

Parameter(s):  <cdf-path>
                  The pathname of the CDF to dump (do not enter an
                  extension).

#ifos vms
               /OUTPUT=<file-path>
#else
               -output <file-path>
#endos
                  Redirects the output to a file.  The file created will
                  be named <file-path> (if <file-path> does not have an
                  extension, '.dmp' is appended automatically).  If this
                  qualifier is not specified, the output is displayed at
                  the terminal. 

#ifos vms
               /[NO]SUMMARY
#else
               -[no]summary
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not a summary of the internal records
                  is to be displayed.  The default is to show summary.

#ifos vms
               /[BRIEF | FULL]
#else
               -[brief ! full]
#endos
                  Specifies how the program should produce a dump. The 
                  option full will have all data fields in each IR to
                  be hex-dumped. The brief option, the default, only shows 
                  the summary of the IRs.

#ifos vms
               /[NO]PAGE
#else
               -[no]page
#endos
                  Specifies whether page breakers are added when the dump is 
                  showed on a screen. The default is to have page breakers.

#ifos vms
               /NODATA
#else
               -data
#endos
                  Specifies whether the data portion of variable records, 
                  compressed or not, is showed. The dump including data could
                  be huge.  This option works with "full" dump. The default
                  is not to show.

#ifos vms
               /ZISO8601
#else
               -ziso8601
#endos
                  Specifies whether or not the CDF epoch data should be
                  presented in ISO8601 form with Z. Currently, all epoch
                  data are shown in ISO8601 form without Z.

#ifos vms
               /ABOUT
#else
               -about
#endos
                  Shows the library version that was used to create this tool
                  program.
